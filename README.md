# Timothy Williams' Portfolio Website
This project is a portfolio website created to give a little bit of insight into who I am, what technologies I work with, and what projects I have completed. However, the site can be adapted to the needs of anyone as it utilizes a CMS backend that can be created and changed by anyone.

  * 46% to 0% Error Rate
  * 5263 ms to 3 ms Latency
* Get Meta Data
  * 44% to 0% Error Rate
